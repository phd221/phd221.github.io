Hello everyone!  My name is Phillip Henry D'Andrea and I am currently a senior at Lehigh University in Bethlehem PA.  I am studying Computer Science and Engineering with a focus in systems architecture.  I am from Marlton New Jersey, which is about 15 minutes from Philadelphia and 45 minutes from the south Jersey beaches.  Some of my hobbies include watching and playing soccer, hanging out with friends, and obviously, coding.
